# UNvoting
Cohort 27 Capstone Project for the Certificate of Data Science at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies.

This project uses United Nations General Assembly and Security Council voting records, supplemental data, and natural language processing to train a classification machine learning model to predict how countries will vote on any given resolution. The final model produces predictions with an F1 score of .8362, with variation based on the class (“yes”, “no”, or “abstain'').
